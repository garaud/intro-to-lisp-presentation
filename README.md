## (Gentle) Introduction To Lisp

Markdown and code source about the presentation "Introduction to Lisp"



I use [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to launch the
presentation with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)


You can also find the slides on Slideshare: [(Gentle) Introduction to Lisp](http://fr.slideshare.net/jazzydag/gentle-introduction-to-lisp)
